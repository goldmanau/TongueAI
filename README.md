# TongueAI - Visual Health Insights from the Tongue
## Summary
1. 🧠 Idea in a Nutshell

TongueAI is an AI-powered diagnostic assistant that analyzes images of the human tongue to provide preliminary health insights based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It aims to support early detection of potential health imbalances by identifying visual tongue features such as color, coating, shape, and texture.

## Background
2. 📚 Background

In TCM, the tongue is considered a mirror of internal health. Practitioners assess tongue characteristics to infer issues related to digestion, circulation, and organ function. However, this practice is highly subjective and requires years of experience.

Modern healthcare emphasizes early detection of systemic issues—like dehydration, vitamin deficiencies, or digestive disorders—but many people lack access to regular screenings.

Motivation: This project bridges ancient wisdom and modern AI, offering a tool that democratizes access to health insights and encourages proactive wellness monitoring.

## Data sources and AI methods
3. 📊 Data and AI Techniques

🔍 Data Sources

Public datasets of tongue images with labeled features (e.g., Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis dataset).
Augmented datasets using synthetic generation and image transformations.

🧠 AI Techniques

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
- Transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet).
- Clustering for unsupervised tongue type grouping.
- Explainable AI (XAI) tools like Grad-CAM for visual interpretability.
